conda create -n new_env python=3.7

python wsgi.py
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict


NEW WAY:
python wsgi.py
python request.py


How it works?
- So, we have app.py where the predict function is located
  then in request.py we send the data (features) to our server (local in wsgi.py), then predict() returns the prediction
